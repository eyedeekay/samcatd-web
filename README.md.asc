# samcatd-web
Web interface for a thing I think I made so I could configure tunnels with i2pd
on android? I honestly don't remember for sure why I started but it seems like
it's going to be useful at least for that.

Pull requests to allow non-local hosts will not be accepted until after a
variety of auth options are supported well. Not that I expect them.
